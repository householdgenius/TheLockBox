# TreasureChest
An application for family like enviroments for children/teenagers to earn privileges by doing chores.

## Purpose
I created this application to encourage parent to child communication and also provide a way to give incentive to get daily chores completed. 

## How It Works
This application allows the admin to create chores and privileges to be completed and earned by the user. Users, or the child/teen, can complete chores, earn privileges, and see which privileges are active for them.
## Creation
This project was built using an Asp.Net/C#/SQL Backend with a React.js front end. 
## How to Install 
Clone this repo, and then clone this through Visual Studio and find the project in your terminal. 
## Difficulties and Challenges
Getting the active privileges to appear was a big challenge as well as fixing the ability to add an edit a chore because of the multi select for user assignment.
